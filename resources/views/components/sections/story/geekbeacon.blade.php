                    GeekBeacon got its spark through Nixie Pixel - she had been well known in the Linux and Tech world as a Youtuber and media influencer with multiple channels having a reach of well over 300,000. After 10 years in the game, Nixie decided it was high time for a fellowship of Geeks that shared her geeky values and dedication toward social good. In 2017, her vision birthed a community. Fellow creators, geeks and enthusiasts answered the call to learn and support each other. That tiny little flicker of an idea had turned into the blazing light we warmly refer to today as GeekBeacon. - our Guiding Light to All Things Geek.
